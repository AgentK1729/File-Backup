This scrip will let you back all your files up from a UNIX based system.

2) Replace "/foo/bar" with the location of the files that need to be backed up.
3) Replace "backup" with the name you want for the compressed version of backed up files.
4) Open a Terminal, and type "sh ./backup.sh"
5) This will create a tar.gz file with current datestamp.
6) There is also an option to back up a MySQL database
